# 2D-Convolution
Implementation of 2D convolution using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) with parallel algorithms. 

• Performed 2-D convolution on 2 N*N images with each element being a complex number, using parallel computing.
• Applied Fast Fourier Transformation on the images and experimented the algorithm with concepts like MPI Send & Receive, MPI Collective Calls and MPI Task & Data Parallelism on various number of processors, using C.
• Deployed the algorithm on Comet XSEDE supercomputer, using Linux with Shell scripting to submit & run jobs.
